PHASE 1: RESEARCH IMPLEMENTATION STEPS (Weeks 1-15)
GNN Baseline vs. TFT Primary — Airspace Collision Risk Prediction

WEEK 1 - Setup
1. Initialize Git repository with folders: data/, src/, notebooks/, models/, experiments/
2. Install and run MLflow locally, confirm tracking UI works
3. Register for OpenSky Network API access
4. Write a script to pull sample ADS-B state vectors for Southern California airspace
5. Download NTSB accident database
6. Write a short data dictionary documenting available fields

WEEK 2 - Feature Engineering and Labeling
1. Write function to compute haversine distance between two aircraft
2. Write function to compute closing speed
3. Write function to compute bearing difference
4. Write function to compute vertical separation
5. Write function to compute time to closest point of approach (CPA)
6. Combine functions into a pipeline that runs on every aircraft pair within 50nm
7. Label each pair as collision risk / not using ICAO separation minima
8. Run exploratory data analysis: class distribution, feature distributions, correlations

WEEK 3 - Imbalance Study
1. Build a shared evaluation harness for the imbalance study (AUROC, precision, recall, F1, PR curve, false negative rate)
2. Train a logistic regression baseline without any imbalance handling
3. Train logistic regression baseline with SMOTE oversampling
4. Train logistic regression baseline with focal loss
5. Train logistic regression baseline with class weight scaling
6. Log all three runs and their precision-recall curves to MLflow
7. Compare results and select the best imbalance strategy to carry forward

WEEK 4 - Graph Construction
1. Write function to convert a time-window snapshot into a graph structure (aircraft = nodes, proximity pairs = edges)
2. Attach engineered kinematic features as edge attributes
3. Validate graph construction on a sample time window
4. Build a dataset class producing a sequence of graph snapshots

WEEK 5 - GNN Baseline Implementation
1. Implement a GNN model class for edge-level binary classification (GraphSAGE or GAT)
2. Build the training loop (forward pass, loss, backprop, optimizer step)
3. Apply the winning imbalance strategy from Week 3
4. Run a short training pass to confirm the pipeline works end-to-end

WEEK 6 - GNN Tuning and Evaluation
1. Set up Optuna study to tune GNN hyperparameters (hidden size, layers, learning rate, dropout)
2. Train the tuned GNN to convergence
3. Evaluate using the shared harness from Week 3
4. Log all runs and final tuned model to MLflow
